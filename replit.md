# AIÁû¨ÈñìËã±‰ΩúÊñá„ÉÅ„É£„ÉÉ„Éà (AI English Composition Chat)

## Overview

This is a mobile-first English composition training application that helps users practice translating Japanese sentences to English. The app provides instant feedback and corrections using AI, with a LINE-style chat interface optimized for smartphone usage. The project's vision is to offer a comprehensive, engaging, and effective platform for English learners to improve their composition skills, leveraging AI for personalized and immediate feedback, thereby catering to a broad market of language learners.

**MAIN PAGE**: The core of the application is the level selection page (CompleteTrainingUI.tsx) featuring 6 difficulty levels: TOEIC, ‰∏≠Â≠¶Ëã±Ë™û, È´òÊ†°Ëã±Ë™û, Âü∫Êú¨ÂãïË©û, „Éì„Ç∏„Éç„Çπ„É°„Éº„É´, „Ç∑„Éü„É•„É¨„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥Á∑¥Áøí. This page uses background color #e7effe with admin/mypage buttons positioned at the absolute right edge of the screen. This is the central hub users return to after any debug/refresh scenarios.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project focus: Mobile-optimized English learning app with instant feedback and comprehensive progress tracking.
**Learning Flow**: Problem ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Evaluation/Explanation/Similar Phrases„ÉªNext Problem (continuous flow with 1 second interval).
**Critical Issue**: Agent-Preview synchronization problems preventing UI updates and console control. User reports persistent console display issues that Agent cannot directly resolve due to communication limitations.

## Identified Root Causes (Resolved)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors blocking app builds (fixed React imports)
- ‚úÖ import.meta usage requiring ES2020+ module configuration
- ‚úÖ Missing React imports causing UMD global references
- ‚úÖ Agent-Preview sandbox restrictions preventing direct UI control
- ‚úÖ Build process failures due to module resolution conflicts
- ‚úÖ Critical: Frontend infinite loop in useEffect causing repeated API calls
- ‚úÖ Replit host allowedHosts configuration (added specific domain to vite.config.ts)
- ‚úÖ Port 5000 Express+Vite integration (server correctly serving on port 5000)
- ‚úÖ Stripe secrets configuration (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET added)
- ‚úÖ **SERVER STARTUP FIX (Aug 5, 2025)**: Fixed workflow configuration issue where npm run dev was calling vite instead of Express server
- ‚úÖ **CHAT UI TRANSFORMATION (Aug 6, 2025)**: Replaced static evaluation UI with LINE-style chat interface for natural conversation flow
- ‚úÖ **CLAUDE 3 HAIKU INTEGRATION (Aug 6, 2025)**: Implemented real-time AI evaluation with detailed explanations, grammar analysis, and alternative expressions
- ‚úÖ **CHAT HISTORY PERSISTENCE (Aug 6, 2025)**: Fixed chat message clearing issue - all problems, answers, evaluations remain visible in continuous scroll
- ‚úÖ **SEQUENTIAL PROBLEM NUMBERING (Aug 6, 2025)**: Implemented proper problem counter with dynamic numbering based on chat history
