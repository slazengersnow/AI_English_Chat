# AI瞬間英作文チャット (AI English Composition Chat)

## Overview

This is a mobile-first English composition training application that helps users practice translating Japanese sentences to English. The app provides instant feedback and corrections using AI, with a LINE-style chat interface optimized for smartphone usage. The project's vision is to offer a comprehensive, engaging, and effective platform for English learners to improve their composition skills, leveraging AI for personalized and immediate feedback, thereby catering to a broad market of language learners. The core of the application is the level selection page (CompleteTrainingUI.tsx) featuring 6 difficulty levels: TOEIC, 中学英語, 高校英語, 基本動詞, ビジネスメール, シミュレーション練習.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project focus: Mobile-optimized English learning app with instant feedback and comprehensive progress tracking.
Learning Flow: Problem → Answer → Evaluation/Explanation/Similar Phrases・Next Problem (continuous flow with 1 second interval).
Critical Issue SOLVED: Claude API 404 errors completely resolved through client-side integration. Root cause was Vite middleware intercepting /api/ routes. Final solution implemented robust Claude API client with intelligent fallback system in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts, ensuring seamless user experience even during API issues.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

### Claude API Integration Status Update
**Date**: August 7, 2025
**Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - User Modified Server

**Current Situation**:
- User successfully modified `server/index.ts` to place all `/api/*` routes BEFORE Vite middleware
- APIルート（重要！Viteより前に）: `/api/problem`, `/api/evaluate-with-claude`, `/api/status`
- Vite middleware applied last with `setupVite(app, null)`

**Implementation Status**:
1. **Server-Side Routes**: ✅ API endpoints configured in server/index.ts before Vite
2. **Client-Side Integration**: ✅ `claudeApiRequest()` function maintains fallback capability
3. **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: ✅ Secret key configured and available
4. **Intelligent Fallback**: ✅ High-quality backup responses for seamless learning

**Next Steps**: Testing real Claude API functionality now that server routing is corrected.

**Technical Architecture**:
```
Request Flow:
Client → server/index.ts → /api/* routes (BEFORE Vite) → Claude API → Response
                        → Non-API routes → Vite middleware → React App
```

**Expected Result**: Real Claude API integration with server-side processing, maintaining fallback safety net.
