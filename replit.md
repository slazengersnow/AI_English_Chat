# AIÁû¨ÈñìËã±‰ΩúÊñá„ÉÅ„É£„ÉÉ„Éà (AI English Composition Chat)

## Overview

This is a mobile-first English composition training application that helps users practice translating Japanese sentences to English. The app provides instant feedback and corrections using AI, with a LINE-style chat interface optimized for smartphone usage. The project's vision is to offer a comprehensive, engaging, and effective platform for English learners to improve their composition skills, leveraging AI for personalized and immediate feedback, thereby catering to a broad market of language learners.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project focus: Mobile-optimized English learning app with instant feedback and comprehensive progress tracking.
**Learning Flow**: Problem ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Evaluation/Explanation/Similar Phrases„ÉªNext Problem (continuous flow with 1 second interval).
**Critical Issue**: Agent-Preview synchronization problems preventing UI updates and console control. User reports persistent console display issues that Agent cannot directly resolve due to communication limitations.

## Identified Root Causes (Resolved)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors blocking app builds (fixed React imports)
- ‚úÖ import.meta usage requiring ES2020+ module configuration
- ‚úÖ Missing React imports causing UMD global references
- ‚úÖ Agent-Preview sandbox restrictions preventing direct UI control
- ‚úÖ Build process failures due to module resolution conflicts
- ‚úÖ Critical: Frontend infinite loop in useEffect causing repeated API calls
- ‚úÖ Replit host allowedHosts configuration (added specific domain to vite.config.ts)
- ‚úÖ Port 5000 Express+Vite integration (server correctly serving on port 5000)
- ‚úÖ Stripe secrets configuration (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET added)
- ‚úÖ **SERVER STARTUP FIX (Aug 5, 2025)**: Fixed workflow configuration issue where npm run dev was calling vite instead of Express server
- ‚úÖ **CHAT UI TRANSFORMATION (Aug 6, 2025)**: Replaced static evaluation UI with LINE-style chat interface for natural conversation flow
- ‚úÖ **CLAUDE 3 HAIKU INTEGRATION (Aug 6, 2025)**: Implemented real-time AI evaluation with detailed explanations, grammar analysis, and alternative expressions
- ‚úÖ **CHAT HISTORY PERSISTENCE (Aug 6, 2025)**: Fixed chat message clearing issue - all problems, answers, evaluations remain visible in continuous scroll
- ‚úÖ **SEQUENTIAL PROBLEM NUMBERING (Aug 6, 2025)**: Implemented proper problem counter with dynamic numbering based on chat history

## Implemented Solutions

- Created new ProblemPractice component with explicit state machine using useReducer
- Implemented absolute initialization lock (initializationLock.current) to prevent double execution
- State transitions: loading ‚Üí show_problem ‚Üí waiting_user_input ‚Üí evaluating ‚Üí show_result ‚Üí wait_for_next_button
- Eliminated all automatic problem generation - ONLY manual button clicks trigger new problems
- Removed auto-generation from simulation-practice.tsx to prevent cross-file interference
- Rebuilt chat-interface.tsx with minimal functionality to prevent side effects
- Empty dependency arrays [] and strict mounted checks to prevent infinite loops
- **REPLIT PREVIEW CONFIGURATION (Aug 5, 2025)**: Complete server integration
- Express+Vite middleware integration on port 5000

- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY synchronized with Replit Secrets
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET configured
- Port 5000 ‚Üí External Port 80 mapping for Replit preview URL
- Minimal test app serving correctly via https://...kirk.replit.dev
- **SERVER STARTUP RESOLUTION**: Workflow was running `vite` instead of Express server. Fixed by manually starting `tsx server/index.ts` which properly integrates Vite middleware and serves on port 5000
- **COMPLETE SERVER INTEGRATION (Aug 5, 2025)**: Created dedicated `run-server.mjs` with Express+Vite integration
- Express API routes (/api/problem, /api/evaluate) configured BEFORE Vite middleware to prevent 404 errors
- Server properly binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 with Replit port mapping (local 5000 ‚Üí external 80)
