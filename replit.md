# AIÁû¨ÈñìËã±‰ΩúÊñá„ÉÅ„É£„ÉÉ„Éà (AI English Composition Chat)

## Overview

This is a mobile-first English composition training application that helps users practice translating Japanese sentences to English. The app provides instant feedback and corrections using AI, with a LINE-style chat interface optimized for smartphone usage. The project's vision is to offer a comprehensive, engaging, and effective platform for English learners to improve their composition skills, leveraging AI for personalized and immediate feedback, thereby catering to a broad market of language learners.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project focus: Mobile-optimized English learning app with instant feedback and comprehensive progress tracking.
**Learning Flow**: Problem ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Evaluation/Explanation/Similar Phrases„ÉªNext Problem (continuous flow with 1 second interval).
**Critical Issue**: Agent-Preview synchronization problems preventing UI updates and console control. User reports persistent console display issues that Agent cannot directly resolve due to communication limitations.

## Identified Root Causes (Resolved)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors blocking app builds (fixed React imports)
- ‚úÖ import.meta usage requiring ES2020+ module configuration
- ‚úÖ Missing React imports causing UMD global references
- ‚úÖ Agent-Preview sandbox restrictions preventing direct UI control
- ‚úÖ Build process failures due to module resolution conflicts
- ‚úÖ Critical: Frontend infinite loop in useEffect causing repeated API calls

## Implemented Solutions
- Updated tsconfig.json module setting to "esnext"
- Added React imports to fix UMD references
- Created emergency demo access routes (/auto-demo, /force-demo)
- Implemented console minimization scripts and CSS injection
- Documented manual Console control via üîß wrench icon
- Fixed Google OAuth redirect URL to use dynamic current domain
- Created OAuth testing and debug page (/oauth-fix)
- Implemented multiple authentication fallback methods
- Created fresh Supabase client to bypass cached configuration
- Developed comprehensive final auth test page (/final-auth-test)
- Implemented Replit-specific OAuth configuration using REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN
- Created Replit-optimized authentication page (/replit-auth-fix)
- Resolved Preview environment OAuth restrictions
- **CRITICAL REBUILD (Aug 2, 2025)**: Completely rebuilt training interface from zero
- Replaced complex TrainingInterface with SimpleProblemPractice using useReducer
- Implemented strict 1-problem-only architecture with manual step control
- Eliminated all useEffect-based automatic problem generation across ALL files
- Fixed infinite loop by removing mutation chains and auto-triggers in simulation-practice.tsx
- Created clean state machine with useReducer: initial ‚Üí loading_problem ‚Üí showing_problem ‚Üí evaluating ‚Üí showing_result
- Removed auto-generation from simulation practice to prevent cross-file interference
