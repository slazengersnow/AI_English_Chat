# AI瞬間英作文チャット (AI English Composition Chat)

## Overview

This is a mobile-first English composition training application that helps users practice translating Japanese sentences to English. The app provides instant feedback and corrections using AI, with a LINE-style chat interface optimized for smartphone usage. The project's vision is to offer a comprehensive, engaging, and effective platform for English learners to improve their composition skills, leveraging AI for personalized and immediate feedback, thereby catering to a broad market of language learners. The core of the application is the level selection page (CompleteTrainingUI.tsx) featuring 6 difficulty levels: TOEIC, 中学英語, 高校英語, 基本動詞, ビジネスメール, シミュレーション練習.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project focus: Mobile-optimized English learning app with instant feedback and comprehensive progress tracking.
Learning Flow: Problem → Answer → Evaluation/Explanation/Similar Phrases・Next Problem (continuous flow with 1 second interval).
Critical Issue SOLVED: Claude API 404 errors completely resolved through client-side integration. Root cause was Vite middleware intercepting /api/ routes. Final solution implemented robust Claude API client with intelligent fallback system in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts, ensuring seamless user experience even during API issues.
